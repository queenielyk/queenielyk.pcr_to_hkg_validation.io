# Take PCR to Hong Kong
People going to Hong Kong under Covid-19 should prepare a negative PCR report and an ISO15189 certificate within 48hours before the last flight take off. In this case, the time difference should be taken into account.
Some people were unable to onboard because of the expired PCR report. As a result, finding a verified PCR lab and counting the execution time is laborious.
